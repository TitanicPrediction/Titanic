Titanic
=======
For the Coursera Class - Developing Data Products, I used the Titanic Disaster dataset.  The Shiny app can be seen here.

This Shiny App has two tabs.
 - A Summary tab to analyze basic counts and death rates of categorical variables.
 - A Survival Calculator tab applies Logistic Regression to the dataset, allowing the user to change variables to see the    impact on survival.
