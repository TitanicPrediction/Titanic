Titanic
=======
This Shiny App will apply the logistic regression weights of the survival model to predict the probability of surviving the Titanic disaster.  The plan is to have two tabs using a navbar.  The first tab has summary level analysis, with charts and visuals of the variables.  The second tab will be the predictive modeling tool that scores passengers with a likelihood of surviving the disaster.
